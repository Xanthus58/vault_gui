# Welcome to VaultGUI
### A mock frontend bank management system for an sql database.

# ü§î What's vault_gui?
![Alt text](/assets/demo.gif)

Vault GUI is a very small lightweight application designed to mimic a basic banking system. Its designed to replicate systems similar to those that you'd find at places like [mykidsbank](https://mykidsbank.org/). It allows you the freedom to manage the financial systems of your dreams, from admin accounts, user accounts, transactions, loans, interest, collateral. All in a easy to use application, just enter some basic information such as your MYSQL ip address, login information and let the application handle the rest.
